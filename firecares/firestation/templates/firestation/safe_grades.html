                            The <strong>Safe Grade</strong> is a comparison of the Community Risk Score with the Fire Department Performance Score.

                        <p>
                            SAFE Grade represents the possibility of civilian injury or death, firefighter injury or death and/or property loss based
                            on how well the Fire department <u>resources</u> are deployed to <u>match the level of risks</u> in a structure fire.

                        <p>
                            There are 3 safe grade comparison categories.
