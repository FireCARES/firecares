                                FireCARES categorizes fire departments by their respective Fire Department ID code (FDID = the ID code used for data entry into the NFIRS system).  For some cities, towns, or other municipalities contained within larger County jurisdictions, these FDIDs may be similar.  If you are unable to locate your fire department by entering the name of your jurisdiction in the search bar, then please search for the county containing your fire department.  To find your jurisdiction, letâ€™s see if it is contained within the larger county by entering the county name in the search bar and then checking the fire station addresses contained in the county list.  If your stations are contained in the county list, please go to the <a href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">Contact Us</a> page on the FireCARES site and provide us the list of your stations with complete street addresses.  You will be contacted within 1 week to verify the information and assure that your area is broken out of the larger county jurisdiction.

                            <p class="ct-u-marginTop10">
                                To classify the hazard level of the structure where a fire occurred, that fire needed to be geocoded and tied to a physical parcel. That parcel also needed to have information about the structure present. If the geocode of the fire did not get tied to a parcel (structure) or there was insufficient information describing that parcel then that fire was classified as an N/A. In most cases, this was due to issues the geocode of the fire placing the fire in the middle of street versus at a particular parcel. We are continually working on improving the quality of the geocoding, so this should improve over time.
