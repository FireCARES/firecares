                                The Fire-Community Assessment Response Evaluation System, known as FireCARES,
                                is a &quot;big data&quot; analytical system providing important information to fire service and
                                community leaders about their local fire department and the risk environment in which
                                firefighters are called to respond. FireCARES includes more than a decade of research
                                on structure fires and related injuries and death, as well as building footprints, housing
                                and mobile home units, public health and census data, and vulnerable populations.
                                FireCARES combines large sets of data from various sources to &quot;tell the story&quot; of a fire
                                department in regard to its risk environment, resource capacity, and overall capability to
                                respond to emergency incidents.

                                in the search bar and then checking the fire station addresses contained in the county list.
                                If your stations are contained in the county list, please go to the

                                To classify the hazard level of the structure where a fire occurred, that fire needed to be
                                geocoded and tied to a physical parcel. That parcel also needed to have information about the
                                structure present. If the geocode of the fire location did not get linked to an actual parcel
                                (structure) or there was insufficient information describing that parcel then that fire was
                                classified as an N/A. In most cases, this was due to the address (geocode) of the fire placing
                                the fire in the middle of street versus at a particular parcel address. We are continually working
                                on improving the quality of data from your system using a new data extraction module known as
                                NFORS CAD and we are also working to improve  the geocoding, so this situation should improve
                                over time. The better the data in the system, the more accurate the outcomes will be. To learn

                                FireCARES and NFORS are parallel projects both funded by the Department of Homeland Security/FEMA
                                Assistance to Firefighters Grants.  NFORS is a data gathering application (software) that
                                links with a fire departments CAD or records management system (RMS) to ingest operational data
                                directly without additional firefighter input.  That data can then be analyzed with in the
                                NFORS system for instant reports and it can be loaded into the FireCARES system for use in
                                calculating and updating a fire department's Performance Score and Safe Grade.

                                Yes.  The NFORS project was developed in parallel and is linked to the Fire Community Assessment
                                Response Evaluation System (FireCARES) Project. The NFORS modules and reports have been designed
                                to be user friendly, encourage accurate and timely data entry, and allow data exchange with systems
                                like FireCARES. In fact, the first NFORS module being field tested is in conjunction with the FireCARES
                                project.

                                Field testing for the first NFORS module began in September 2016.  The first module is known as
                                NFORS-CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch).  This module is implemented via a fire department's CAD or
                                RMS (Records management System) for automatic extraction of operational data for ALL TYPE responses.
                                The NFORS-CAD may require programming modification to a local CAD to assure that the appropriate
                                operational data elements are captured.  As operational data flow from a local fire department
                                CAD system into the NFORS-CAD Library, they are available for use in local department reporting
                                and will also appear in the fire department's FireCARES page.

                                Additional modules will begin field testing soon including the NFORS Firefighter Exposure Module
                                that links to the NFORS-CAD Module creating a response diary for individual firefighters.
                                This NFORS Firefighter Exposure Module is being used by AFG funded grant projects for firefighter
                                cancer surveillance.
