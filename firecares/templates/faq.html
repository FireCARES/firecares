                                The Fire-Community Assessment Response Evaluation System, known as FireCARES,
                                is a &quot;big data&quot; analytical system providing important information to fire service and
                                community leaders about their local fire department and the risk environment in which
                                firefighters are called to respond. FireCARES includes more than a decade of research
                                on structure fires and related injuries and death, as well as building footprints, housing
                                and mobile home units, public health and census data, and vulnerable populations.
                                FireCARES combines large sets of data from various sources to &quot;tell the story&quot; of a fire
                                department in regard to its risk environment, resource capacity, and overall capability to
                                respond to emergency incidents.

                                the performance scores will become more precise. (See NFORS information below)

                                department.  To find your jurisdiction, let's see if it is contained within the larger county
                                by entering the county name in the search bar and then checking the fire station
                                addresses contained in the county list.  If your stations are contained in the county list,

                                This situation exists because NFIRS datasets are continuously 2 years behind primarily
                                due to data quality checks. Therefore, for FireCARES to work as intended, it is
                                imperative that departments provide access to current response data through their
                                records management system (RMS) or from their CAD system directly to the National
                                Fire Operations Reporting System (NFORS) CAD Module. With NFORS, there is no
                                cost to the department and no additional effort for firefighter data input. Additionally,

                                application (software) that links with a fire departments CAD or records management
                                system (RMS) to ingest operational data directly without additional firefighter input. That
                                data can then be analyzed with in the NFORS system for instant reports and it can be
                                loaded into the FireCARES system for use in calculating and updating a fire
                                department's Performance Score and Safe Grade.

                                reports have been designed to be user friendly, encourage accurate and timely data entry, and
                                allow data exchange with systems like FireCARES. In fact, the first NFORS module being field
                                tested is in conjunction with the FireCARES project.

                                Field testing for the first NFORS module began in September 2016. The first module is known
                                as NFORS-CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch). This module is implemented via a fire
                                department's CAD or RMS (Records management System) for automatic extraction of
                                operational data for ALL TYPE responses. The NFORS-CAD may require programming
                                modification to a local CAD to assure that the appropriate operational data elements are
                                captured. As operational data flow from a local fire department CAD system into the NFORS-CAD
                                Library, they are available for use in local department reporting and will also appear in the
                                fire department's FireCARES page.

                                Module that links to the NFORS-CAD Module creating a response diary for individual firefighters.
                                This NFORS Firefighter Exposure Module is being used by AFG funded grant projects for
                                firefighter cancer surveillance.

                                FireCARES categorizes fire departments by their respective Fire Department ID code (FDID = the ID code used for data entry into the NFIRS system).  For some cities, towns, or other municipalities contained within larger County jurisdictions, the FDIDs may be similar.  If you are unable to locate your fire department by entering the name of your jurisdiction in the search bar, then please search for the county containing your fire department.  To find your jurisdiction, let's see if it is contained within the larger county by entering the county name in the search bar and then checking the fire station addresses contained in the county list.  If your stations are contained in the county list, please go to the <a href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">Contact Us</a> page and provide us the list of your stations with complete street addresses.  You will be contacted within 1 week to verify the information and assure that your area is broken out of the larger county jurisdiction.

                                To classify the hazard level of the structure where a fire occurred, that fire needed to be geocoded and tied to a physical parcel. That parcel also needed to have information about the structure present. If the geocode of the fire did not get tied to a parcel (structure) or there was insufficient information describing that parcel then that fire was classified as an N/A. In most cases, this was due to issues the geocode of the fire placing the fire in the middle of street versus at a particular parcel. We are continually working on improving the quality of the geocoding, so this should improve over time.
