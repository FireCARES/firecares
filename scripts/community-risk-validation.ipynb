    "\n",
    "### Risk Model\n",
    "\n",
    "All community assessment values are based on *predicted* metrics based on a NIST-developed risk model, current department coverage with _some_ data from the risk model is subset of the total number of fire departments.  The risk model does not necessarily include values that would be required to accurately calculate ALL 3 assessments on each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fire Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "The community assessment in regards to fire risk for a specific department calculates the relative risk to similar departments in the same population class for the given structure hazard level.  This relative risk uses the predicted # of fires per year as the benchmark for risk, which is then ordered from least to greatest number of fires for the department and evenly split into 4 groups.  Departments that fall into the 1st group (lowest # of fires) are considered \"Low\" risk when compared to their peers in the same structure hazard level, those that fall into the 2nd and 3rd groups are considered \"Medium\" risk and those that fall into the last group (those with the greatest number of fires) are considered \"High\" risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fire Spread Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the fire risk assessment, the community assessment for fire _spread_ risk ONLY takes into account the predicted percentage of fires that extend beyond room of origin (the sum of size2 and size3 fire percentages relative to all fires for a department).  The predicted percentage of fires that spread beyond room of origin is then ordered in the same manner as in the fire risk assessment and divided into 4 each groups ranked from least to greatest percentage of fires that spread beyond room of origin, using the same risk designation, \"Low\", \"Medium\" and \"High\", assigned to the first, second/third and fourth groups, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Death and Injury Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Death and injury risk takes into account the predicted # deaths and injuries caused during or response to fires per year [I *BELIEVE* THIS IS ALL DEATHS/INJURIES, INCLUDING FIREFIGHTERS AND CIVILIANS] for a department.  Similarly to the other 2 community assement metrics, the death and injury risk is a relative risk to other departments in the same population class and in response to structures of the same hazard level."
