FireCARES
=========
The FireCARES application


## Getting Started

A quick way to get started is with Vagrant and VirtualBox.

### Requirements

- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

```
git clone https://github.com/FireCARES/firecares.git
git clone https://github.com/FireCARES/firecares-ansible.git
cd firecares-ansible
vagrant up
```

Wait a few minutes for the magic to happen.  Access the app by going to this URL: http://192.168.33.15

### Development Considerations

When you install FireCARES using Vagrant, the default configuration will restart the Gunicorn process on every request
so your server-side modifications should immediately show up.

For client-side changes, you currently need to manually run the `collectstatic` in order to update the static assets. You
can run collect static from the `firecares-ansible` directory on the host machine using the following command:

`ansible-playbook vagrant.yml -i vagrant_server --tags django.collectstatic`
